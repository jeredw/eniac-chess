; We use all 75 words for board, globals, and search stack

; - Piece and Player constants -
; There are two kinds of piece representations used: "board piece" and "player|piece"
; Player|piece is the obvious one, has player in high digit and piece in low digit.
; This is the format returned from get_square and stored in fromp, targetp

; While the board is stored in a two-level encoding, get_square returns player|piece as below
WHITE   .equ  0
BLACK   .equ  1

; Note that 1) OTHER pieces RK are contiguous and 2) sliding pieces BQRK are contiguous
PAWN    .equ  1
KNIGHT  .equ  2

QUEEN   .equ  4
ROOK    .equ  5

; Incremental score for pawn to queen promotion (must be equal to queen-pawn)
PBONUS  .equ  24


; - Board representation - 
; We have room for only a single board, stored as 64 digits in 32 words in addresses 0-31.
; But six pieces times two players plus empty is 13 states, so we encode rooks/king as OTHER.
; This is the "board piece" representation

WKNIGHT .equ 3
WBISHOP .equ 4
WQUEEN  .equ 5

BKNIGHT .equ 7
BBISHOP .equ 8
BQUEEN  .equ 9

; OTHER means white/black rook/king, so we store their locations in a separate piece list.
; We'll always have only one king and two rooks per side (no reason to promote to rook)
; This allows us to represent any number of promoted queens
wking  .equ 32
bking  .equ 33
wrook1 .equ 34
wrook2 .equ 35

; If square is occupied with OTHER and it's not king or wrook, it's brook
; Hence we only need four words to define the location of six pieces.


; - Globals -

; fromp - player and piece currently to move. 
; Player in high digit, piece in low digit, which we write as player|piece.
; It's not in the stack because we can find it by calling get_square with [from] 
; Once initialized that way, it's awfully useful to know whose turn it is.
fromp  .equ 36

; mscore - material score advantage for white
; One word does not have enough resolution for a full board evaluation, but 
; only the delta matters during a search. In 4 ply, we won't overflow.
; Plus 50, so 50 means a tied material score (no captures, or an even trade)  
; Updated incrementally during move and undo_move.
;
mscore  .equ 37

; The zero value for score is set at 50 so values < 50 are negative.

; - Stack - 
; 28 words of memory form a 4-level software stack for alpha/beta search.
; Each stack entry is split into two parts, with 5 words for move state and
; 2 words for alphas and betas per level.
;
; Instead of indirecting through a stack pointer, the top of the move stack
; is kept at a fixed address to save code space. This requires copying on
; push and pop.
